use AI and extensions to apply a large sets of companies across the globe
    


1 coding   third

target logically correct code and syntax correct at first place,
after code, check if mistake, test with sample input,check for signal from interviewer
dry run
variable names

2 data structures and algorithms, 2nd

find data structure
start from suboptimal and build upon
space and time complexity
take hints for approach


3 design,   first

understand question well
how gather requirements
edge cases
assumptions
take advantage of language


4 efficacy 4th

speed to code correct sol
accuracy also, dont need iterations
no hints is basic criteria
interviewer may in not interative too, try to have a convo


5 comprehention communicaion and testing  5th

communicate
write testcases
cover conrner and null cases
do a time check
also dont rush
try to be crisp
ice breaker question
tel me abt ur self
dont waste time for intros

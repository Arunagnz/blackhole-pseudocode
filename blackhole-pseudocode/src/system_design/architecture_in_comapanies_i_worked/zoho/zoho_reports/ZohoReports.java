/*
requirement for a trash model for entities in a reporting application, Zoho reports,  
entities is like tables, charts, summary views, pivot tables, etc.

Implemented the Trash Model for entities in Zoho reports. when deleting parent entities, all child entities 
will be deleted as well.
and when restoring the child entity, all parent entities will be restored.

users are able to soft delete and restore any type of entity and don't have to think about parent or child dependencies. 
the system takes care of everything.

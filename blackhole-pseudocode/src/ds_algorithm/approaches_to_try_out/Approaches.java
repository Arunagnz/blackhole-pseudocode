Iteration
hashmap
reverse traversal
reversals
swaps
counting variables
two pointers
floyds cycle detection
stack
two stacks
queues
dequeu
compound keys for hashmaps
map+queue - lru, 
map+heap - expiries,or order based popping
map+arraylist - random playlist,with swap to end to optimize removal 
heaps
kadane
bfs
bfs level by level
dfs
Tail recursion - preorder
head recursion - inorder, postorder
head recursion assignment strategy
memoization - top down - backtracking - (only recursion)
tabulation - bottom up - (only iteration)
leverage Prev Diag elem in 2d matrices
dp on string, leverage prev diag, max(prev row, prev col)
sorting
greedy, usually sort because of some ordering involved to differentiate local solution

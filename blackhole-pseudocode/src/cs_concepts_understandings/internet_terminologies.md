DNS: The Domain name server is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers connected to the internet. DNS maps internet domain to IPs.

DNS TTL: DNS caches name server queries upto the time specified as the TTL(time to live). until TTL expires it will just return the cached response rather than retrieving from authoritative nameserver again.

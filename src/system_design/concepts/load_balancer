Redundancy protocol:

Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) 
Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) - elections for master with polling
Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) 




Service discovery: What backends are available in the system? What are their addresses (i.e., how should the load balancer talk to them)?
Health checking: What backends are currently healthy and available to accept requests?
Load balancing: What algorithm should be used to balance individual requests across the healthy backends?

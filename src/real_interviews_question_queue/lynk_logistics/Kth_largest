Find the K-th element
You are given an array containing N distinct integers. You perform the following operations on this array:

For each pair of integers, you find the absolute difference D between those integers and insert D into the array (if it was not already present in the array).
You repeat task 1 until the array becomes constant. This implies that the absolute difference between any two elements in the array is also an element present in the array.
Write a program to find the Kth largest element of the array after all the operations have been performed. If there is no such element, print -1.

Input format

First line: T (Number of test cases)
First line in each test case: N
Second line in each test case: N space-separated integer (denoting the elements of the array)
Third line in each test case: K
Output format

For each test case, print the Kth largest element of the array. If there is no such element print -1.

Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N,K≤10000
1≤ Element of the array ≤100000

Sample Input

Sample Output
6
-1
Explanation
Elements of the array after performing the above operation {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} . Hence 2nd largest element will be 6.

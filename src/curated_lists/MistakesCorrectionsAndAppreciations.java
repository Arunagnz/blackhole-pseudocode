  /*
  
  // mistakes:
  
  Readability:
    1. 2 variables in one line
    2. variable names should be concise and precise
    3. missing braces for single line blocks or coding if's in a single line

  Logical:
    1. Not using helper method is taken as negative
    2. written more code than required, compress if statements using proper && and || statements
    3. unnecessary modification of inputs 
    4. unwanted space creation, staring to char array, dont use char[]
    5. always use proper data structures
  
  General: 
    1. not reading the question properly.
    2. failed to rereview written code to correct or optimize further.
    3. test all code and code changes
    4. always notify changes in code/approach made later.
    5. think aloud.
    6. ability to code faster will be recognized, but should not compensate accuracy for that.
    7. ask clarifying question as much as possible.
  
  Technical:
    1. always use objects as much as possible/ or clarfy the same.
    2. Use stringBuilder wherever possible
  
  
  
  // Appreciations:
  1. tested written code
  2. used proper data structures
  3. finished fast
  4. used string builder
